Chapter 1 Mapping Primitives

	[
		These work like 'above' and 'below' to permit creation of one-way connections.  (See Section 3.3 of Writing with Inform for documentation.)
		Example 1 - How 'above' works with up and down
			Foo is above Bar.					- creates a two-way link: Bar -up-> Foo -down-> Bar
			Foo is a room above Bar.			- creates a one-way link: Bar -up-> Foo
		Example 2
			Foo is eastward from Bar.			- two-way: Bar -east-> Foo -west-> Bar
			Foo is a room eastward from Bar.	- one-way: Bar -east-> Foo
		Above and below are defined in the Standard Rules extension.  The definitions are:
			The verb to be above means the reversed mapping up relation.
			The verb to be below means the reversed mappind down relation
		No corresponding tokens for the compass directions are found in the Standard Rules.

Section 1.1 Eight Compass Primitives

	[ defined anticlockwise from south... ]

The verb to be southward from means the reversed mapping south relation.
The verb to be southeastward from means the reversed mapping southeast relation.
The verb to be eastward from means the reversed mapping east relation.
The verb to be northeastward from means the reversed mapping northeast relation.
The verb to be northward from means the reversed mapping north relation.
The verb to be northwestward from means the reversed mapping northwest relation.
The verb to be westward from means the reversed mapping west relation.
The verb to be southwestward from means the reversed mapping southwest relation.

Section 1.2 Miscellaneous

	[ inward from, outward from ]
The verb to be inward from means the reversed mapping inside relation.
The verb to be outward from means the reversed mapping outside relation.

Chapter 2 Proof of Concept

A proof_room is a kind of room. 	[ we want to make sure this works with subclasses! ]

The description of a proof_room is usually "A strange room -- an arc of about 45 degrees.  The only exit seems to be clockwise."

Section 2.1 One-Way Connections

	[ two random rooms - we'll start in R0, go around a ring and end in R9 ]

R0 and R9 are proof_rooms.

The description of R0 is "You're standing outside a strange and possibly magical round house.".

The description of R9 is "The way back seems to have disappeared.  There seems to be a crawl leading up, but it isn't clear that you'll be able to return.".

	[ A clockwise ring of rooms. ]

R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 are proof_rooms.

The description of R1 is "The circle of rooms continues clockwise and it appears that you can go outside from here.".

The description of R2 is "You're in what appears to be a circle of rooms but for reasons that aren't clear, you can't get back outside from here, and you are being forced clockwise.".

R1 is a room westward from R2.  R2 is a room northwestward from R3.  R3 is room northward from R4.  R4 is a room northeastward from R5.  R5 is a room eastward from R6.  R6 is a room southeastward from R7.  R7 is a room southward from R8.  R8 is a room southwestward from R1.

The passkey is a thing in R7.

	[inward from, outward from ]

R9 is a room outward from R1.   R2 is a room inward from R0.

Before going outside when the location is R1:
	if the player is not carrying the passkey, say "A force field stops you from passing through.  A disembodied voice says 'You need the passkey.'" instead.

Section 2.2 Endgame

The treasure room is a room above R9.  The description is "Good news!  You found the treasure!  :)[paragraph break]Bad news!  There is no way out.  :(".  

The gold crown is a thing in the treasure room.

Chapter 3 Testing

When play begins:
	say "NOTE:  Exits are listed in the status line below the name of the noom.".

Test me with "inside/ w/ outside/ sw/ s/ take passkey/ se/ e/ ne/ n/ nw/ w/ outside/ up"
