All files are text.

Those with names that start with `story_ni_` are Inform 7 story files which be renamed `story.ni` and placed in an Inform 7 source directory.  Typically these will be found in a folder having a pathname like `[prefix]/Projects/[projectname].inform/Story`. Another use is to simply copy and paste into your own stories.
